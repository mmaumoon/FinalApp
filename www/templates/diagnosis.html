Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease. 
<img class="full-image" src="/img/gene.jpg">
People with CF have inherited two copies of the defective CF gene -- one copy from each parent. 
<p></p>
<img class="full-image" src="/img/carrier.png">
Both parents must have at least one copy of the defective gene.
People with only one copy of the defective CF gene are called carriers, but they do not have the disease. 
<img class="full-image" src="/img/body.jpg">
Each time two CF carriers have a child, the chances are:<p></p>
<div class="item item-body">25 % (1 in 4) the child will have CF.</div>
<div class="item item-body">50 % (1 in 2) the child will be a carrier but will not have CF.</div>
<div class="item item-body">25 % (1 in 4) the child will not be a carrier and will not have CF.</div>
<p></p>
The defective CF gene contains a slight abnormality called a mutation. There are more than 1,700 known mutations of the disease.

Most genetic tests only screen for the most common CF mutations. Therefore, the test results may indicate a person who is a carrier of the CF gene is not a carrier.

According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, in the United States:
More than 30,000 people are living with cystic fibrosis (more than 70,000 worldwide).
<p></p>
Approximately 1,000 new cases of CF are diagnosed each year.
More than 75 percent of people with CF are diagnosed by age 2.
More than half of the CF population is age 18 or older.
